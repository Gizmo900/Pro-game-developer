#While Loop Practice

while i >= 1: #keep looping while i is atleast 1.
    print(i) #show the current value of i.
    i=i - 1 #decrease i by one each time.


#Keep asking the user to enter numbers until they type 0.

while num !=0: #Repeat as longis not 0
    print("you entered:",num) #show the number is not 0
    num=int(input("enter an number(0 to stop):")) #askes again

#Print the sum of digits of a number (e.g., 123 â†’ 6).

sum_digits=0 #start total sum at 0
while num > 0: #repeat until the number becomes 0

    sum_digits=sum_digits + digit # add the digit to the sum
    num=num//10 #remove the last digit (integer division)- it is showing only the integer part-ignores the decimal part.
